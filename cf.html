        The story
        </h2>
        <p class="first">
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
            commiserate. They said, <q class="vil">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer
            said, <q><em class="farm">Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
            everybody came back and said, <q class="vil">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <q><em class="farm">Maybe</em>.</q>

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q class="vil">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><em class="farm">Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the
            conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
            broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="vil">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><em class="farm">Maybe</em>.</q>

            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
            whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="picture"> <em class="good">good</em> and <em class="bad">bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are  <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not  <em class="good">good</em> for bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...<br>
                This is a classic example of point of view. If you look at the picture you see the
                <em class="good">good</em> on left and the
                <em class="bad">bad</em> on the right. But if you stand in front of the man, the
                <em class="good">good</em> is on the right and the <em class="bad">bad</em> is on the left.</p>
